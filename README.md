## Nix(OS) - Revolutionizing packaging and configuration management!

### Viewing the slides

Simply open [index.html](index.html) in your web browser.

### Running the server (for speaker notes, etc.)

Running `nix-shell` in this directory should already be enough.

Presentation link: http://localhost:8000/?fragments=true#/
(`?fragments=true` enables the fragments during the presentation and also works
correctly for the speaker mode which can be enabled by pressing `s`).
